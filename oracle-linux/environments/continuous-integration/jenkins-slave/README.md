# Jenkins Slave based on Oracle Linux

Use this with [the Mesos plugin for Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Mesos+Plugin). It is based on Oracle Linux and adds some prerequisites and build tools. This is an adaptation of [evarga/jenkins-slave](https://hub.docker.com/r/evarga/jenkins-slave/).
